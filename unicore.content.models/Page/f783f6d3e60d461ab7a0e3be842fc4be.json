  "content": "Breastmilk is a baby's 'first immunization'. It helps to protect against\ndiarrhoea, ear and chest infections, and other health problems. The protection\nis greatest when breastmilk alone is given for the first six months and when\nbreastfeeding continues along with other foods well into the second year and\nbeyond. No other milks, foods or supplements can provide the protection of\nbreastmilk.\n\nBreastfeeding helps a mother and baby form a close, loving relationship - a\nprocess called bonding. The close contact and attention help infants feel\nsecure and loved, which is important for their growth and development.\n\nThe father and other family members can help by encouraging the mother to rest\nquietly while she breastfeeds the baby. They can also make sure the mother has\nenough nutritious food and help with household tasks and caring for older\nchildren\n\n",
